<summary><h2>The Problem</h2></summary>
<p>
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today, and its effects are already being felt around the world. From rising sea levels and extreme weather events to biodiversity loss and food insecurity, the impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and potentially catastrophic.<br>
<br>
The urgency of addressing climate change cannot be overstated. Failure to act now will lead to even more severe consequences in the future, including more frequent and intense natural disasters, reduced access to clean water, and widespread displacement of people.<br>

<summary><h2>Our Impact</h2></summary>
<p>
Our team's goal is to play an active role in stopping climate change and mitigating its effects. We recognize the urgency of the situation and the catastrophic consequences that will occur if we fail to act.<br>
<br>
To achieve our goal, we will work together to reduce our own carbon footprint, implement sustainable practices in our operations, and advocate for systemic change. We will seek out and support renewable energy sources, reduce waste and promote recycling, and educate ourselves and others on the importance of sustainable living.<br>
<br>
We understand that stopping climate change is a global effort, and we are committed to working with other individuals, organizations, and governments to make a meaningful impact. By taking action now, we can create a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.<br>
